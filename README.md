DSA Practice Repository
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of essential DSA concepts implemented in C, developed through self-study and online learning resources. It serves as a resource for practicing, revisiting fundamental concepts, and improving coding skills.

üìÇ Repository Structure
The repository is organized into individual C files, each corresponding to a specific data structure or algorithm. Below is a summary of the key components:

1. Arrays
array.c: Array implementation with traversal, insertion, deletion.
array_ADT.c: Abstract Data Type (ADT) implementation of arrays.
2. Trees
AVL_tree.c: Implementation of AVL trees (self-balancing binary search trees).
BST.c: Binary Search Tree operations including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Binary_Tree_Linked.c: Linked-list-based binary tree implementation.
3. Graph Traversal
BFS.c: Breadth-First Search traversal algorithm.
DSF.c: Depth-First Search traversal algorithm.
4. Sorting Algorithms
Bubble_Sort.c: Classic bubble sort algorithm.
Quick_Sort.c: Quick sort implementation.
Merge_Sort.c: Merge sort implementation.
Insertion_Sort.c: Insertion sort implementation.
Selection_Sort.c: Selection sort algorithm.
Count_Sort.c: Count sort algorithm.
5. Linked Lists
Linked_List.c: Singly linked list with insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Doubly_Linked_List.c: Doubly linked list with full operations.
Circular_Linked_List.c: Circular linked list operations.
6. Queues
Queue_Array.c: Queue implementation using arrays.
Queue_LinkedL.c: Queue implementation using linked lists.
Circular_Queue_Arr.c: Circular queue implementation using arrays.
DEQueue.c: Double-ended queue (deque) implementation.
7. Stacks
Stack_Array.c: Stack implementation using arrays.
Stack_LinkedList.c: Stack implementation using linked lists.
8. Other Algorithms
InfixToPostfix.c: Infix to postfix expression conversion.
Parenthesis_matching.c: Algorithm to check balanced parentheses.
üåü Features
Clear and Concise Code: Each file is written to demonstrate the basic functionality of the data structure or algorithm in a straightforward manner.
Self-Learning and Practice: These implementations are part of my journey to mastering DSA, designed for learning and practice.
Expandability: This repository will be updated with additional comments, optimizations, and advanced data structures as I continue to improve my knowledge and skills.
üìà Future Enhancements
Add detailed comments and explanations for all files to make the code more understandable.
Refactor code for better optimization and performance improvements.
Implement more complex data structures and algorithms.
Use database integration for future projects where applicable.
