# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-DSA-Practice
This repository contains my implementations of essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C. It covers arrays, linked lists, trees (AVL, BST), sorting (Quick, Merge, Bubble), stack, queue, BFS, DFS, and more. Developed for self-practice and learning, with plans to enhance code documentation and optimize performance.
